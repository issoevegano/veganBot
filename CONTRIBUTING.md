# Contributing

## Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to VeganBot! With people like you we can make veganoBot a great tool! :green_heart:

The project is divided in two parts: the API, where we register all the products, and the chatbot that request this API to get the information it needs.  
## Bot
The code for the bot is **[HERE](https://github.com/issoevegano/veganoBot)**
* Is written in JavaScript
* Uses [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) to handle NLP and interact with what the user says

## API
The code for the API is **[HERE](https://github.com/issoevegano/isso-e-vegano-api)**
* Is written in Python, using [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

## More details [IN CONSTRUCTION]
I'm still organizing an way to run and test everything, to make easy to anyone contribute, but is a work in progress.
