# veganBot

## The problem
Is very hard for vegan go shopping without a list of what products are vegan[1] and what are not. We always have to check on internet, ask a friend for recomendations and sometimes it takes a lot of time.  
So the idea of this project is to make this search easier.

## About
Is a project to help people find vegan products in a easy way.
* Is a **colaborative** guide to list vegan products
* Is a **chatbot** that makes consulting the list more practical and simple.

  ### *what is a chatbot?*
  *A chatbot is a computer program that interacts with people via a chat interface (like facebook messenger) and behave as a human conversational partner.*

* Talking to veganBot will be like asking suggestions to a vegan friend

This is an open source project and is still a prototype, so to work properly and help everyone, needs collaboration.

## How to contribute
This project is completely open and collaborative, so everyone can contribute:
* If you have a list of products or know some products that are vegan, **share [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R8rAPOaEdo4ohI93GwPQhaQQvJXprzOlma5JwSknx9M/edit?usp=sharing)**
* If you are a developer and can help with your technical knowledge, **check [here](CONTRIBUTING.md)**
* If you want to help organize the communication between the list and the chatbot, or want to know others ways you can help, send a email to ***issoevegano@gmail.com***
